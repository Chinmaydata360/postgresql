Just completed a 17-question SQL analytics challenge covering sales, customers, inventory, and operations!

Learned how to:

ğŸ”¹ Find top-selling products & revenue contribution by category
ğŸ”¹ Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) & Average Order Value (AOV)
ğŸ”¹ Spot monthly sales trends, payment success rates, and shipping delays
ğŸ”¹ Build insights into returns, profit margins, and stock alerts

This exercise helped me sharpen:

ğŸ”¹ Advanced SQL (window functions, CTEs, ranking, trend analysis)
ğŸ”¹ Business analytics thinking (turning raw data into insights)
ğŸ”¹ Understanding of key e-commerce KPIs

Excited to apply these learnings in real-world data integration & analytics projects!
